# certgen

A CLI tool to assist in generating and handling your own CA and certificates for servers. The tool is exceptionally opinionated to my current personal use cases, but I hope others find it useful regardless.

## Assumptions

All certificates are generated as EC certificates.

## Installation

No command that produces files will override any file that already exists, it's just not safe when it comes to certificates and chains.

## Usage

### `generate_root_ca`

### `generate_server_certificate`

###Â `generate_client_certificate`
